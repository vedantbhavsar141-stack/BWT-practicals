<h2 align="left">My first experience in the university</h2>
<font color="blue">
    <p align="left"> My first experience at university was a mixture of exhilarating freedom and daunting newness, where the sprawling campus and the sheer volume of students initially felt overwhelming, but soon gave way to the excitement of new friendships, challenging coursework, and the gradual discovery of my own independence as a nascent adult. The atmosphere was a blend of nervous energy from newcomers like myself and the confident buzz of returning students, creating a palpable sense of anticipation for the adventures and challenges that lay ahead.</p>

<h3 align="right">About computer</h3>
<font color="blue">
    <p align="right"> A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts data, processes it to perform calculations or other operations, and produces an output, often storing the results in the process. Considered one of the most significant inventions, computers have become indispensable to modern life, used across various fields like education, communication, business, healthcare, and entertainment. They operate on binary code (0s and 1s), but their user-friendly interfaces allow humans to input information in high-level languages, which the computer then converts to perform tasks like sending messages, managing data, and accessing vast amounts of information online.  </p>
